# Writing analysis

This repository is part of a project to provide an open source
learning analytics dashboard to help instructors be able to manage
student writing processes.

There isn't much to see here for external collaborators yet. This
repository has a series of prototypes to confirm we can:

* collect the data we want;
* extract what we need from it; and
* route it to where we want it to go (there's *a lot* of data, with
  complex dependencies, so this is actually a nontrivial problem)

Which mitigates most of the technical risk.

For this to be useful, we'll need to integrate all of this together,
and provide some basic documentation for developers to be able to
navigate this repo (in particular, explaining *why* this approach
works).

A few files are missing too (our test cases have developer PII, our
deployment pipelines hardcode names of servers, etc.). We'll want to
clean those up and post those too. Until that's done, I recommend
ignoring this repo as a not-yet-mature open source project.

Our immediate goals are to provide a dashboard which gives rapid,
actionable insights to educators supporting remote learning during
this pandemic.
