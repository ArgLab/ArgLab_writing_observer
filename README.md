# Writing Observer and Learning Observer

![Writing Observer Logo](learning_observer/learning_observer/static/media/logo-clean.jpg)

This repository is part of a project to provide an open source
learning analytics dashboard to help instructors be able to manage
student learning processes, and in particular, student writing
processes.

## Learning Observer

_Learning Observer_ is designed as an open source, open science learning
process data dashboarding framework. You write reducers to handle
per-student writing data, and aggegators to make dashboards. We've
tested this in math and writing, but our focus is on writing process
data.

It's not finished, but it's moving along quickly.

## Writing Observer

_Writing Observer_ is a plug-in for Google Docs which visualizes writing
data to teachers. Our immediate goal was to provide a dashboard which
gives rapid, actionable insights to educators supporting remote
learning during this pandemic. We're working to expand this to support
a broad range of write-to-learn and collaborative learning techniques.

## Status

There isn't much to see here for external collaborators yet. This
repository has a series of prototypes to confirm we can:

* collect the data we want;
* extract what we need from it; and
* route it to where we want it to go (there's *a lot* of data, with
  complex dependencies, so this is actually a nontrivial problem)

Which mitigates most of the technical risk. We also now integrate with
Google Classroom. We also have prototype APIs for making dashboards, and
a few prototype dashboards.

For this to be useful, we'll need to provide some basic documentation
for developers to be able to navigate this repo (in particular,
explaining *why* this approach works).

This system is designed to be *massively* scalable, but it is not
currently implemented to be so (mostly for trivial reasons;
e.g. scaffolding code which uses static files as a storage model). It
will take work to flush out all of these performance issues, but we'd
like to do that work once we better understand what we're doing and
that the core approach and APIs are correct.

Getting Started
===============

As an early prototype, getting started isn't seamless. Run:

~~~~~
make install
~~~~~

And follow the instructions. You'll probably run into bugs. Work around the bugs. Then fix up the makefile and make a PR to address those bugs :)

Once that's done, run:

~~~~
make
~~~~

Again, fix up the makefile, and make a PR.

Writing Observer
~~~~


To setup writing_observer on top of the learning observer platform you must go into modules/writing_observer and run:

   sudo python setup.py develop






=======
You can also go into the devops directory, which has scripts in
progress for spinning up a cloud instance and managing flocks of
_Learning Observer_ instances.



System requirements
===================

It depends on what you're planning to use the system for.

The core _Learning Observer_ system works fine on an AWS nano
instance, and that's how we do most of our testing and small-scale
pilots. These instances have 512MB of RAM, and minimal CPU. It's
important that this configuration remains usable.

For deployment and more sophisticated uses (e.g. NLP) in larger
numbers of classrooms, we expect to need **heavy** metal. As we're
playing with algorithms, deep learning is turning out to work
surprisingly well, and at the same time, requires surprisingly large
amounts of computing power. A GPGPU with plenty of RAM is helpful if
you want to work with more sophisticated algorithms, and is likely to
be a requirement for many types of uses.

All _Learning Observer_ development has been on Linux-based platforms
(including Ubuntu and RHEL). There are folks outside of the core team
who have tried to run it on Mac or on WSL, with mixed success.



~~~~
Additional System-Specific Notes
~~~~

RHEL systems require the addition of the rh-python38 packages.
You also must also install the separate devel packages.  

The virtualenv once created on RHEL will be stored in your home directory under .virtualenvs.


In order to use the client you will need to be logged into both the user account *and* Chrome.
