      "essay": "I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They help you stay in touch with family in a couple different ways they excercise your mind and hands and help you learn and make things easier. Computer's help you keep in touch with people. Say you live in @LOCATION1 and you miss your @CAPS1. You can just send an e-mail and talk all you want. If you don't just want to limit it to words you can add pictures so they can see how much you've grown or if you are well. Even if you're just e-mailing someone down the block it is just as effective as getting up and walking over there. You can also use a computer to make a scrap book card or slide show to show how much you love the person you give them to. Computers @MONTH1 not excercise you whole body but it excersises you mind and hands. You could play solitaire on the computer and come away @PERCENT1 smarter than before. You can play other games of strategy like checkers and chess while still sitting at home being comfortable. Your hands always play a big role while you're on the computer. They need to move the mouse and press the keys on a keyboard. Your hands learn all the keys from memorization. It's like the computer's teaching handi-coordination and studying habit for the future. Computers make human lives easier. Not only do they help kids turn in a nice neatly printed piece or paper for home work but they also help the average person. Teachers use it to keep peoples grades in order and others use it to write reports for various jobs. The @CAPS2 probably uses one to write a speech or to just keep his day in order. Computers make it easier to learn certain topics like the @LOCATION2 history. You can type something into a searcher site and have ton's of websites for one person with, who knows how much imformation. Instead of flipping through all the pages in a dictionary you can look for an online dictionary, type in the word and you have the definition. Computers have positive effects on people because they help you keep close to your family, they challenge your mind to be greater and excercise your hands and they make life easier for kids and the average person. This is why, I think computers have good effects on society",

      "essay": "Dear @CAPS1, I know some problems have came up where some individuals do not agree with the benefits that computers provide us with. I am writing this to get my voice out, or how computers can only help us. Computers teach us hand eye coordination which is an essential skill for many new jobs is this day and age. Not only do computers teach this hands skill but they allow for us to learn of faraway places without actually going to that place and they allow is to talk and intersit with our friends, family and even! Computers are incredible in that they give us the chance to learn of a place where we can not go. Since the creation at the internet, studies have proven that our country's overall average intelect has increased by over @PERCENT1! @PERSON2 has a remark a this subject.\"\" I am astranded that such a simple idea has turned out to be the largest virtual library has ever known!\"\" I could not help but to agree with him. Many people have learned of faraway places, reachable and unnexchable, in amazing detail just by viewing articals that the internet and computers offer. I have to admit that you have to sit down and read @CAPS2 which doesn't benefit you physically but it majorly benefits you mentally in a very minimum amount at time. Hand eye coordination is one of the most underectinated skills that computers provide. Technology is only going to advance, so why not get i over with and adapt to the new ways that things are being done by? Hand eye coordination is an essential skill in the jobs we have @DATE1. Someone who has expirienced hand eye coordination would tell you that the practice and the was with it because they can get papers and projects done faster, and more efficiently. A fast typer can make as much as @MONEY1 an hour when they first set hired! Only computers teach this skill and it is almost imposible to learn this skill from something else. A new advancement in technology allows as to interact with one friends, family, and over forieners! Besides the cheap monthly cost of the internet, most of @CAPS2 services are completely free! Instead of wasting minutes on your exposive cellular phone, you can just chat with your friends and family online for free. @CAPS2 free social services can even connect you with people in different countries, so you can learn about their lifestyle and culture as I did! @PERSON1 says, \"\"@CAPS2 advancements are remarkable and everybody should take advantage of @CAPS2 services.\"\" I hope what I've said has an impact on you. Like I said before technology is only going to advance, so be love to adopt to it. Please take into consideration that computers train essential hand eye coordination, they allow us to pull articals of faraway places from a massive virtual library and they allow us to interact with our friends family, and people from all of life",

Its the people computers are their their to help peopl can knoledge but people take advantage of that. People make their own in life and they can control eather they want to do excersise or not. They, always have the on other objects for what they suposably didn't do. In a couple people can go anywhere and reaseach everything. Poeple who stay at a computer @NUM1 hours a day are making discison. Its not like a computer tell you not to do something people beleive that technology as a person into doing things. Well their wrong. Its the person who is letting technology take control. Because if they wanted to they could possibly stop and go out side for a walk or run. What they don't know is they are the one. So now you understand what im trying to say. People other things over ther own actions",

      "essay": "Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 has come to my attention that some people do not believe in our in technology and their computers. I however believe that computers are amazing things that make life not only easier, but more enjoyable as well. Computers teach hand-eye coordination which is available through sports as well, but much easier for the unathletic through computers. Not only do computer give us skills but they allow us to learn of the people nd places to us. Yet computers are not so along with getting information on far away people and places you can actualy talk to a person from anywhere around the world! In our local comunity only about @NUM1 of the population are at and capable of truly hand -eye coordination through sports. This is where computers are useful. They can teach hand-eye coordination to anyone. This skill is taough by a hand- held controler called a mouse that once moved will also move a person or the computer screen. This is a vere effective techmique that is even useful with special people. Computers give us access to pictures and information on far away people or places. This is a very useful thing, since @CAPS3 allows you, our local paper, accurete news ion both distant and local events. @CAPS3 is also proven that students have a better on of a place if they can see @CAPS3. If by a terrible chance computers were removed from our society, our students would reserve lower scores on world geography quizzes or even tests. By such a reasoning taking away computers taking our knowledge on places. Computers not only help to give us a better understandings on foreighn places, but they also allow us a one on one @CAPS5 with people of such places. Such a things our knowledge. @CAPS3 also allows people contact with family or friends @CAPS3 is very painful to know you will never see somore you care for again but computers lead that pain. Computers also to news, for example if a family member was about to one could just get on the computer and a culture. If one were to a letter saying by the they got there @CAPS3 could be too late. And thus I implore you, our local paper, to support our fight to keep computers. Some people @MONTH1 say that computers internet as with people but @CAPS3 actualy encourage out.People my online through websites suhc as facebook and myspace. These amazing machines give us skills, information, and easy @CAPS5 like nothing else",

      "essay": "Dear Local newspaper, I think that people have lately spent too much time on their computers. People who have been doing so are increasing the percentage of obecity. The reason I am writing this to you is because the percentage of obecity is currently increasing, people are spending less time exercising and spending less time interacting with others. First, the percentage of obecity is increasing. The reason is that people just stay indoors, they never feel the need to be fit. This is also risking their lives, all they do is just sit and eat. This could risk the chances of getting deceases. For example, lets say a person spends nearly @NUM1 hrs a day on the computer. This person ate salty foods which risked high cholesterol. While this person was using the computer this person had a heart attack. Second, the people who use the computer are not exercising. These people need to exercise, its good for them, it helps them avoid having to take trips to the hospital, by that I mean not getting heart attacks. It is important to at least exercise for @NUM2 hrs. a day. Do something like take a walk in the park, go hiking, ride a bike, do push ups. There's all kinds of things you could do. For example, there was once a man that all he did was use the computer, he once used to be athletic until his mother gave him a computer. After that he only used the computer, he never exercised nor comunicated with his friends. That was until his friends told him that he was too addicted to that machine. So his friends helped him get back on his feet. Finally, people don't interact with their own friends and family. This is the biggest thing that you should be concerned because with computers people don't interact with themselves and @MONTH1 cause relationships to get ruined. The difference between the average man and the man that uses computers is that the average man actually has a job and has to support his family, while the man that uses computers all he actually does is play games or use the social networks to communicate with strangers. In conclusion, you should be concerned about people's use of computers. It increases obecity. It decreases the interaction with others and you'll spend less time exercising and more time on the computer. Please do the whole world a favor and just go out to play or exercise",

      "essay": "Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 is in my firm belief that to many people spend far too much time on their computers these days. Computers can be a very useful tool, but they can also be very harmful. I think that being on a computer consistently (day after day), degrades a person's communication skills, @CAPS2 lowers the exercise they get which hurts their healthy, but if a person manages to balance this time equally betwenn being on a computer and everything else in life then you will succed. Although computers are very valuable resources, spending too much time on them could hurt a person's communication skills. For example, if you sit on your butt all day in front of a computer you won't have any interaction with the outside world. So the next time you actually talk (and not just e-mail or text) someone, you will flounds. You won't know what to say or how to act because you haven't done @CAPS2 for so long. Now I understand that in some jobs you have to work on a computer all day. That's fine @CAPS2's just when you do @CAPS2 nepeditivley that @CAPS2 starts to harm you. You won't be able to laugh and joke around with your friends the way you used to because you'll be spending the whole time thinking about what to say next. Typing to your friends on your computer is much different than actually greating to them in person. These reasons are why I seriously believe that spending time on a computer will will your communication skills. No matter the you are on the computer. Besides hurting your communication skills. Spending too much time on the computer gives you no. Having no exercise is very unhealthy and can lead people to becoming obese. Another harmfull is sitting around all day, only exercising your fingers can lead to arthritis which is becoming a bigger problems in young people not only can you get arthritis, but there are many more dangerous symtoms of having on your computer for too long. The main problem is in the lack of of health that you develop and we all know how important our health is. @CAPS2 can affect our progress how we and just lives in general. So spending to much time on a computer is a serious health issue because of the lack of exercise that you receive. Though not all is bad with the computer. @CAPS2 seem very valuable tool and is a great source of knowledge. Only be our time equally between the time we spend on the computer and the time we give to everything else in the world. Do we achieve. For instance maybe you want to look up the symtons of mans. Okay spend about an hour on the computer in searching and then go out side and play with your dog in the bright @DATE1 day. You could even combine your time on the computer with a friend. Play a video game together joke and laugh. So computers are in great thing, but we must be able to balance our time on them and on everything around us. In conclusion I say again that a computer is a great tool, only when @CAPS2 is not abused. People cannot spend too much time on the computer because @CAPS2 degrades their communication skills and ruins their health because @CAPS2 allows no exercise, however when we balance our time between the computer and everything else we got the best of both world message",

So she went down there and they told her she should of came in because the didn't get the application from the computer. She was mad she stayed there and argued for a whole @NUM3 minutes. Do you love to watch music videos almost everyday? Almost everychild that has a computer in there house watches music videos because they have nothing else better to do.

      "essay": "Dear @CAPS1, I agreed with the people that feel that people should spend more time with the family instead of being stuck on the computer or laptop. I know that computer could be fun to chat or play game but also need to spend more time with your family for example go camping and parks, swim, fish, and go on vacation. Also want to spen as much time as posible just in case something gose wrong you will always remember the good times you had together. You also could help your grandparint build a gardin or play games. Instead of being a computer or a laptop you could big food chlose for you or your children you can even go to a restaurant. You can do al sorse of thing instead of beang on the computer. You can even go to a zoo to learn about all of animal. Like I sed I dont wayst your time on a computer on somewere and enjoy your life",

      "essay": "Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I do not believe that computers are helping today's society. I feel computers are making our situation here in @LOCATION1 worse. Now a day's you see less people in parks playing catch or teenagers signing up for there local sports team, because they're too busy signing up for a \"\"@CAPS3 @CAPS4\"\" acount. People are for example when I went to work with my aunt I saw so many adults on their laptos during there lunch brake, instead of enjoying their limited time off to relaxe and get out of the office. Me a s a teenage girl hear my friends always talk about how they meet this cute boy on \"\"@CAPS3 @CAPS4\"\" or \"\"@CAPS7\"\". when they don't even know if the boy is a boy at all. So so I don't think that's safe for teenagers or adults. Another example is when I was watching the news yesterday a man was selling his truck on \"\"@CAPS8 @CAPS9\"\". One person took the pffer but they kept on changing the location of were they were going to meet to pick up the car. When tehy finaly picked a location they met. (@CAPS10 was a secluded area). They buyer wasn't planning on buying the car he was going to rob the man and kill him. This proves that the internet isn't safe. My final plea is ther isn't alot of people visiting their families and friends instaed they email them. my opinion is @CAPS10's not the same, you can't spend quality time with a email. You can't send love by instant messaging. I know this because my brother is a @LOCATION2 @CAPS11 and he sends me and my brothe picture mail of him in @LOCATION3. @CAPS10's not the same I will still miss how he would tease me or embarass me infront of my friends and computers and emails will never replace that",

      "essay": "Imagine that you walk into a friends home and their home is just actually dirty. That the reason they don't got time to clean is because their just always playing on the @CAPS3 technology. The issue is, people are getting lazy, and most of them won't want to spend time with their loved ones, also they'll start to get addicted to it. It is now or never to help these young people with their weakness as being on the internet. What would you do if you were to be with someone who was always on the internet doing nothing? Your trying to help them and they won't do it because they're just too used of doing nothing. Your house is a mess just because of the fact that they're too lazy. Well this is whats causing all this trouble. People attend to get used of being on the @CAPS3 doing nothing. That is just unacceptable, @CAPS1 have to do something bout this. Also computers are making most families, and couples break up. Do you really know what's causing this, is all of the @CAPS3 technology. It's hard for families to stick together and connect if their children are always playing games on the @CAPS3 and the father/mother is on the internet. This can also bring conflict to the family well only because if the kids are on the @CAPS3 while one of the parent is trying to get on that could bring conflict. And conflicts always mislead to something worst. @CAPS2 lets just try to stop using the @CAPS3 to prevent this from happening. @CAPS2 your trying to go to your friends house but he wen't up the @CAPS2 you think something going on with him. @CAPS2 you to his house to see whats going on and you come to find out is their just paying too much to the @CAPS3 because of this game. But just everytime you'll try to hang out with him he's hooked on to that same game. @CAPS2 you try to help him out by going on the date. While your on the date he's all sweaty @CAPS2 your asking him why and he says the reason why is because he is not playing the game @CAPS2 this is just leading to a conclusion which is that he's addicted to the game. This is one of the most dangerous things to happen. The time is now to help people to get up and out of all these crazy stuff. Would you want to have a lazy friend living with you? Would you want your family to break up because of a technology system? Or do you want to be with a boyfriend who's addicted to the technology called \"\"@CAPS3\"\"? @CAPS2 let's help and prevent all of these things to happen to anyone",

      "essay": "Dear people of the @LOCATION1, I would like to inform you on the dangers of computes. Picture, if you will, an empty world. @CAPS8, there are people all right but they are all at home. On their computers, wasting away and being slowly blinded in front of the screen. Imagine empty streets and parks. Children streaming out of the school doors and into the sweet smell of freedom that lies, ready in the air of @DATE1 vacation. They are excited But only so they can spend their @DATE1 on the @CAPS1, @CAPS2'ing, chatting, on @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5, @CAPS6, bliss, or whatever it is they do. The point is that @DATE1 is the time of outdoors sun, heat, sand, beaches, pool, comp, friends. Not solely to electric devices. Because if anyone was on the computer all the time (adults included) nothing would get done. Babies would cry, would grow wild, houses unpainted, taxes un-accounted, criminals let loose and the innocent victim would remain in terror, waiting for the day @CAPS7 comes back for her. You @MONTH1 say \"\"@CAPS8, that's hardly probable, of course we'd all got to work.\"\" but I wouldn't be so sure. What would you do if you were \"\"this close\"\" to winning your favorite game, in the middle of an \"\"important\"\" conversation, reading up on @CAPS14 to be economically smart. Exactly you keep your caboose right in that slightly uncomfortable computer chair. But I @CAPS9 the point is nothing that needs doing would get done. The world would fall into chaos. Everyone would need something and no one would be able to tear themselves away from the screen to give it to them. Too much computer exposure could also lead to a rise on what is already a increasing problem obesity. People would gradually gain weight and have no way to release the unneeded calories. Think about it; all of humanity would basically only be doing @NUM1 - @NUM2 things, eating, drinking, using the bathroom, sleeping, and maybe smoking. It's not like the @CAPS1 is @CAPS11 fitness or something all you do is sit, type, store, and click. And as the obesity statistics go up the life expecting will go down. We will die sooner. Is that the kind of them we want over our beads raising our children? \"\"This is a computer @CAPS12 @CAPS13 let me show you @CAPS14 to use it. \"\"@CAPS14 about when @CAPS12 is a obese @NUM3-year-old chain smoking living alone and dying of lung cancer. She wouldn't even be able to get treatment what then huh? What happens to @CAPS12? Do you know what happens when humans don't interact with each other? They became anti-social, hostile and frankly crazy. No one would know @CAPS14 to deal with other people since they stay at home in their own little world. Simple, harmless gestures would scare them and trigger an attacks. We'd be take feral, independent animals we so much as approach another person and all hell breaks lose. We'd be de-evolutionized into a near state of nature. Everyone for himself. In conclusion computers are dangerous and bad for you. However computers in moderation is good. The @CAPS1 can be a bad place when it comes to children or adults. @LOCATION2, teens such as myself. I should know. So please write an article on it, warn the people about the danger they are unknowing subjected to. I'll even give you the headline \"\"The @CAPS18 of the @CAPS1 @CAPS20\"\" @CAPS21 it'd be nothing but benificial to the world",

Computers have affected our lives so much since there creation. Some @MONTH1 think that people are becoming to attached to them, but I think differently. Computers are the source of our knowledge. Lots of what we learn how is from the computer. Computers help to stay in contact with others. They help to communicate back in forth with others on the other side of the world. Computers have also become a great part of school. So keep reading and follow along as you trulu relice how much you are effected by a computer. Where do you get all your information today? How do you find what you looking for? The first thing most of us do is turn to the computer. It's full of information on everything. From how to make potroast to some bizare frog that lives at the tip of @LOCATION1. You can find whatever your looking for on the computer. The only reason we know so much is because of the search engines like @ORGANIZATION3. Using a computer makes it easier to find what ever your looking for or researching. Instead of waiting @NUM1 min. of your pressus time looking up the capital of @LOCATION4 in can encyclopedia you could spend a minute or two searching for it on the computer an discover it's @LOCATION2. The computer just keeps adding more and more information and you can learn more from it then from a book. Lots of people today have facebook, twitter, aim, or at least an e-mail. What do each of these have in common? They are use every day to communicate with others. Our computers help to keep in touch with people we don't see every day or @MONTH1 live on the other side of the world. Best friends can talk about what they did today or a bussness man in @LOCATION3 can talk face to face with this partner in @LOCATION5. About @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people have a family memeber that lives out of there home country, but with out the use of computers how would they keep in touch. They could send letters, but that takes a while to reach the other person and can cost money yoiu can't afford to spend. The computer can let you talk to that person by e-mail, instant messaging, or even face-to-face webcam. Now in school computers are being used more than ever. They contain our books for school, help us write papers, and supply us with the information to do report. For me and other students from our school our school books are located on the computer incase we @MONTH1 forget in bring it home. Most of the esiments I get for @ORGANIZATION1, or @CAPS1 @CAPS2 have to be typed written. Alot of our projects require information suplied by the computer and then the information goes into a powerpoint or word. Languages like @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, or @CAPS6 are being taught on @ORGANIZATION2 connected to the computer. As you @MONTH1 have relized computers are a big part of the things we each day. They help us to learn more, keep in touch, and are a part of school. With out computars life would be alot harder. Computers help to benifit out societ",

      "essay": "Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 opinion on the effect of computers is that they dominate us, and we end up spending far too much time in their grasp. Rather than checking the lates + fashions, or learning that your friend is going to sleep, we should be being productive. We should be doing more useful things with our time, like exercising, enjoying nature, and spending time with our family and friends. Rather than spending all of our time frivolously fooling around on a computer, we should and ought to be exercising. @PERCENT1 of our population is overweight, so we really need to get out and exercise. America @MONTH1 be one of the larger powers in the world, but we have far too many pudgy people. And people who get that way normally do not stop. This leads to overall sloth fullness. The computers is the source of this problem. All of the nature in our world is going fast. The trees are getting hacked down and not replaced. Acid rain from pollution is tearing down acres and acres of dells and hollows full of trees. The habitats being destroyed also lead to the threatening and eventual extinction of many species of animals. So we must go out and see the world, enjoy it, before it is torn to pieces. But we can't because we are far too busy checking the lates @CAPS3 updates. I remember many times asking friends to hang out, but they couldn't because they were too busy on the computer. We must spend time with our family and friends! If we don't people, being people, will have all their feelings bottled up, and than explode on someone because of their choice to be a hermit up, locked in their room on the computer. Though people @MONTH1 argue against its talking on facebook, or emailiing is not communicating. It is just being too lazy to actually be with friends and family. We need to see each other, hold friendships. It is very important for our sanity and well-being. Computers are the source of laziness, and just a temporary way to forget the world. We should be exercising, which would do us a lot of good in an overweight country, enjoying nature before it disappears on as completely, and spending time with the people we love and care about. We are lazy, and computers are the source of the problem. So it's time to uproot it",
